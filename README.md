Database Release Manager

Documentation:

  Scripts are written with robodoc syntax comments.

Note about Mysql >=5.6:
  From version 5.6 of mysql command line command is present an annoying
  warning message like this
     'Warning: Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.'
  when is used a --password argument.
  This warning message broken database-release-manager. I will fix this soon.
